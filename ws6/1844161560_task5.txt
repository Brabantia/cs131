One such, however, the Black Library, has done its readers a tremendous service--and<br /><br />done it for a terrific price, as well.<br /><br />Dan Abnett is almost universally lauded as the best of GW's stable of writers exploring the grim, dark future of its Warhammer 40,000 universe. While his 'Gaunt's Ghosts' series is probably his most popular, and its gritty,<br /><br />in-the-trenches, on-the-front-lines view of the 40Kverse appeals readers of both SF and military fiction, his three volume series about Inquisitor Gregor Eisenhorn and the goings-on within the vast Imperium of Man behind those front lines is arguably his best...so much so that the three paperbacks which made up the series--'Xenos,' 'Malleus' and 'Hereticus' (named for three major branches, or<br /><br />Ordos, of the investigatorial Imperial Inquisition which Eisenhorn serves)--quickly sold out and became secondary market collectibles.<br /><br />Readers have clamoured for an omnibus edition of the three under one cover--and the Black Library has now delivered that, with 'Eisenhorn.' They've added to the collection, however, by including an introduction from Abnett outlining the origins of the project, as well as two interstitial short stories otherwise available only in old issues of the much-missed GW fiction magazine 'Inferno!' They've topped it with a terrific cover painting of Eisenhorn by Clint<br /><br />Langley (after Adrian Smith's original)  and then they've priced the whole package for little more than a third of what the original novels alone cost, new.<br /><br />This is a tremendous series: if you are a fan of action/adventure, space opera, borderline superheroics, or military fiction (particularly of the 'small band of specialists on a mission' subgenre), you are going to find as much to<br /><br />enjoy as the dark science fiction reader the book is ostensibly aimed at...and if you've an interest in any corner of GW's richly-detailed 40K universe, you will not get a better 'feel' for it than you will here. Abnett draws his<br /><br />characters richly and emotionally, conjures a plot around them over the course of the three novels filled with wonderful small moments and an occasional<br /><br />jaw-dropping sequence (the beginning of 'Hereticus' is so good, you will wonder how its climax can ever begin to equal it), but--probably best of all--never loses sight of the series' real star: the unique universe of GW's 41st millennium,<br /><br />which he never fails to find an opportunity to detail and explore, always convincingly.<br /><br />The three books of the 'Eisenhorn' trilogy are my favorite 40K novels thus far. Having them under one cover is a real 'fanboy' delight, a pleasure increased by the bonuses the Black Library has thoughtfully included. And the price<br /><br />point means I will be able to introduce the Warhammer 40K universe to more than a few friends who do not play the games, but whom I know will enjoy these stories.<br /><br />Well-done, GW. Of course, a limited edition of the collection in hardcover would still be even nicer....<br /><br />Christopher Allen<br /><br />+++ok is ostensibly aimed at...and if you've an interest in any corner of GW's richly-detailed 40K universe, you will not get a better 'feel' for it than you will here.

I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of the characters, the complexity of the story, and the multiple plots Dan Abnett devolves throughout the 800+ pages.<br /><br />Eisenhorn is a compilation of three books.  The continuity of the story and consistency of the characters warrants putting all three under one cover.  I found each book  Xenos, Malleus, and Hereticus quite entertaining.  The entire Warhammer 40,000 universe is based on the monolithic struggle of man vs. machine vs. evil vs. everything else.  The Eisenhorn character is an agent of the empire of man whose primary mission is to stand between the onslaught of evil and evil machines and the countless billions of humans who exist in a quazi-techno hell set in the far future (*breath).  His purpose is to stamp out `Heretics' desire to obtain forbidden technology and the countless incursions of beings from an alternate universe called The Warp.  He is accompanied by several characters throughout the book that are developed in concert with Eisenhorn.<br /><br />If you like to read about a never ending war with death and destruction on this kind of scale then I would think you would enjoy this book as much as I did.  I could barely put it down as I was pulled right into the development of Eisenhorn right from page one.<br /><br />I reccomend this book to anyone who is a fan of Sci-Fi	2005-02-08
