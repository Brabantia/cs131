Sigh….this is great news and bad. Maybe I should switch to chi gong or pure yoga. Biking can be 2x’s/week. Lots to think abt. But I’m happier wo the inflammation induced pain.

The above command will answer task 1 if the solution outcome of that one is piped on into a "head" command to chop off all the other results.... I'll just hope the script captured everything, because clearly the history command is useless...

 1038  script a2.txt
 1039  nano a2.txt
 1040  l
 1041  nano a2.txt
 1042  history > cmds.log

The commands used for the homework are missing...
