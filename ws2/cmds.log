Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner      2005-10-14

My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.<br /><br />It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.<br /><br />The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days.    2005-10-14

This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.    2005-10-14
